# Solvers

This repository will consist of personal algorithms projects, dedicated to "solving" in the context of games in an effort to practice implementing algorithmic principles and never lose at family game night again.

This also serves the purpose for me to get into the habit of working with and regularly maintaining some kind of codebase for personal projects outside of the coursework I had for my LMU undergrad.
